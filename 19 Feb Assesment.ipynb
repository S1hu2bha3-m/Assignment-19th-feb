    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity and Minimalism: Flask follows the \"Keep It Simple\" philosophy, meaning it provides only the essentials for web development. This minimalistic approach makes it easy to learn and use, especially for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask has a small core and doesn't impose a lot of dependencies. It allows developers to add only the components they need, which results in faster application development and reduced overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask doesn't dictate a particular way of doing things, giving developers the freedom to choose the tools and libraries they prefer. This flexibility is particularly useful when integrating with other components or third-party extensions."

    "Ans. In Flask, app routing refers to the process of defining URL patterns and associating them with specific view functions, also known as routes or endpoints. When a user makes a request to a particular URL on your Flask application, the app routing mechanism determines which view function should handle that specific request.\n",
    "Using app routes provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: App routes allow you to organize your code into smaller, manageable functions. Each route is responsible for handling a specific URL, making it easier to maintain and update your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: App routes make it clear what each URL endpoint does and how it is handled by the application. This improves the code's readability and makes it more understandable for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: With app routes, you can easily add new pages or functionalities to your web application by defining new routes and view functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful API: When building RESTful APIs, app routes are used to define different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for various resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, app routing in Flask is a fundamental concept that helps you create a well-structured and functional web application or API by mapping URLs to specific functionalities.\n",
